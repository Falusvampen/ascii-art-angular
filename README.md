## Overview 🌟

The ASCII Art Generator is a nifty application designed to render text into ASCII art, seamlessly and interactively. It is a modern iteration of a classic project, leveraging Angular, TypeScript, SCSS, Tailwind, and DaisyUI. This project serves as a reimagination of an initial Golang project, thus elegantly capturing the evolution of both skill and technology.
